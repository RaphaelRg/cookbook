# cookbook

## Set-up
This project is working on a Raspberry Pi B and is a local Web Server.

You would need to set up your Raspberry with
  - Apache and PHP
  - SQL-DB

## Project
The idea of this project is a sort of cookbook for all recipes at home. The web server does not provide a whole recipe, but the place where to find it in different books and places.
The web server provides different options to search for a recipe (Title, Headword, Main Ingridient, ...) and shows the book where to find it.
